      <title>Crema Pasticcera [~Custard]</title>

      <description>IMPORTANT NOTE Be careful when you reheat the mix: it will take a while for it to change viscosity, but it will happen very quickly. If you are not quick enough to take it off the heat you might end up with scrambled eggs. If that happens you can still blend the mix but it will not have the right consistency.
Make also sure to constantly whisk, otherwise your custard will burn or make lumps.</description>

      <description>They can be preserved at room temperature for roughly a week. I strongly advise against freezing.
I think they are best after one or two days, not immediately after made.</description>

      <description>This paste has a high content of umami, which can be used to enhance and prolong a taste.
It can be easily stored in the freezer in an ice-cube mold for later use.</description>

      <title>Panzanella [alla Norma]</title>

      <description>Panzanella is a good way to put your stale bread to good use: nothing goes to waste!
The two optional ingredients are not from the original recipe, but they are a twist I added.
Keep in mind that ingredients and quantities are just a suggestion: feel free to customize this recipe as much as you like!</description>

      <description>This is my quick and simplified version of almond bakies (which are like cookies, but are baked instead of cooked).</description>

      <title>Pesto</title>
      <link>https://empijei.science/cooking/recipes/pesto/</link>

      <description>Preservation Pesto can be preserved in the fridge for a few days and can be frozen if necessary. I personally use an ice-cube mold so I can have pesto-cubes to unfreeze when needed.
Vegan For a ðŸŒ¿veganðŸŒ¿ alternative to the recipe replace both parmigiano and pecorino with finely ground cashew nuts.
Faster For a faster alternative you can put all ingredients in a food processor.</description>
