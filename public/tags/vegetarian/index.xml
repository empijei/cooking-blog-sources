      <description>They can be preserved at room temperature for roughly a week. I strongly advise against freezing.
I think they are best after one or two days, not immediately after made.</description>

      <title>Pesto</title>

      <description>Preservation Pesto can be preserved in the fridge for a few days and can be frozen if necessary. I personally use an ice-cube mold so I can have pesto-cubes to unfreeze when needed.
Vegan For a ðŸŒ¿veganðŸŒ¿ alternative to the recipe replace both parmigiano and pecorino with finely ground cashew nuts.
Faster For a faster alternative you can put all ingredients in a food processor.</description>
