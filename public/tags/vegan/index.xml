      <description>Panzanella is a good way to put your stale bread to good use: nothing goes to waste!
The two optional ingredients are not from the original recipe, but they are a twist I added.
Keep in mind that ingredients and quantities are just a suggestion: feel free to customize this recipe as much as you like!</description>

      <description>Preservation Pesto can be preserved in the fridge for a few days and can be frozen if necessary. I personally use an ice-cube mold so I can have pesto-cubes to unfreeze when needed.
Vegan For a ðŸŒ¿veganðŸŒ¿ alternative to the recipe replace both parmigiano and pecorino with finely ground cashew nuts.
Faster For a faster alternative you can put all ingredients in a food processor.</description>
