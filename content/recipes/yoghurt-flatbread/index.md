category: bread
cuisine: Rob
tags:
  - Vegetarian
yield: 3 pcs
prepTime: 20'
cookTime: 15'

tools:
- Rolling pin
- A flat pan

ingredients:
- 160g unsweetened and unflavored (greek) yoghurt
- 150g flour (plus quite a bit more to work the dough)
- 4g salt
- 8g of baking powder
- To flavor either olive oil and rosemary or butter and sage

directions:
- "**Mix salt, flour and baking powder with the yoghurt** until homogeneous and sticky"
- "**Dust** a work surface with a generous amount of flour"
- Put the dough on the surface and **split** it in 3 or 4 pieces
- "**Add flour** and mix until workable (it should not be too sticky to roll on the outside, it is ok if it is still wet inside)"
- Re-flour the surface and **roll** it to a thin disk (~5mm). Beware the dough is very sticky, if it starts to stick dust with some more flour
- Spread a thin layer of the **flavor** of your choice (e.g. melt the butter with some sage) on one side (You might want to use a brush to help you).
- "**Warm the pan** on medium heat for a while. The pan should be all at the same temperature before continuing."
- Put the flatbread **in the pan with the oiled face down**.
- Keep turning it (not flipping it) a bit every now and then if your heat is uneven.
- After a few minutes (until the bottom starts showing some browning and crisp) **flip it**.
- Cook for roughly the same amount of time on the other side. Be careful that the non-oiled side tends to burn quicker than the other one.
