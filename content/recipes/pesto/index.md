### Preservation
Pesto can be preserved in the fridge for a few days and can be frozen if necessary. I personally use an ice-cube mold so I can have pesto-cubes to unfreeze when needed.

### Vegan
For a **ðŸŒ¿veganðŸŒ¿** alternative to the recipe replace both parmigiano and pecorino with finely ground **cashew nuts**.

### Faster
For a **faster** alternative you can put all ingredients in a **food processor**.
