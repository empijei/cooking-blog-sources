Pesto can be preserved in the fridge for a few days and can be frozen if necessary. I personally use an ice-cube mold so I can have pesto-cubes to unfreeze when needed.

For a vegan alternative to the recipe replace both parmigiano and pecorino with finely ground cashew nuts.

For a faster alternative you can put all ingredients in a food processor.
