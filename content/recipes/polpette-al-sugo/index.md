category: Second dish
cuisine: Italy
tags:
  - meat
yield: 3 portions
prepTime: 30'
cookTime: 25'

tools:
- "[OPTIONAL] Ice cream scoop"

ingredients:
- 200g ground beef
- 150g ground pork
- 15g butter
- 30g stale bread (or crumbs)
- a bit of milk (to soften the bread)
- 1 egg
- 20g parmesan
- parsley
- salt
- pepper
- 1 onion
- 600g diced tomatoes (I use canned ones)
- oregano
- fresh basil
- freshly ground pepper

directions:
- Add **some milk to the bread** (it should become soft)
- Weigh and **mix beef, pork, butter, egg, parmesan, some parsley leaves, the softened bread and add salt and pepper to taste**
- Dice the **onion** and put it in a pan with high sides with some oil, **stir fry** until transparent
- Add the **diced tomatoes (with their sauce), oregano and salt** to the pan and bring to a simmer on medium heat, in the meantime
- use the ice-cream scoop or your hands to **shape the meatballs**
- You can optionally sear the meatballs in a hot pan before starting the cooking in the sauce for extra flavor and texture.
- Once enough meatballs to fill the pan are shaped put them **in the sauce**, they'll need to cook for **20/25 minutes**. 
- Every now and then **delicately flip the meatballs**
- You can use the same sauce to cook multiple batches, but I usually like to make more sauce as it becomes an amazing pasta condiment
- Serve 3/4 meatballs with their sauce, **add fresh basil and some freshly ground pepper**
