cuisine: Misc
tags:
  - apples
  - vegetarian
yield: a cake for 8 slices
prepTime: 15'
cookTime: 40'

tools:
- Oven
- Baking paper
- "I strongly suggest a peeler"

ingredients:
- 300g flour
- 150g white sugar
- 150g room temperature butter
- 4 eggs
- a bit of orange zest (roughly a table spoon)
- 4 tangy apples (I use Jazz variety)
- 12g of baking powder
- a splash of brandy (roughly 15ml but it depends on your taste)
- few table spoons of brown sugar
- "[OPTIONAL] for serving, vanilla ice cream"

directions:
- Take the **butter out of the fridge** (I am sure you forgot to take it out earlier)
- "Pre-heat **oven** (not ventilated) at **180Â°C**"
- Weigh all the remaining ingredients
- "**Mix all the ingredients except apples and brown sugar**"
- "**Peel and coarsely dice the apples** (roughly 1cm)"
- Add the apples to the **mix**
- Put some **baking paper** on the bottom of the baking tin
- Poor the mix in a cake **tin** (it's better if you can open the sides for easier removal)
- Sprinkle a thin layer of **brown sugar on top** (this will provide a nice crunchy top)
- "**Bake for 40'** (or until you see the cake starts getting too brown on top)"
- Before taking out of the oven I suggest putting the tip of a knife deep inside the center of the cake and check that when you take it out there is no raw dough stuck on it
- Let cool down a bit and then open the baking tin

This is one of my all-time favorite cakes, good for all seasons and both for breakfast and dessert.
