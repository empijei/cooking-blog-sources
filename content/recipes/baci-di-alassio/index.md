title: "Baci Di Alassio"
image: baci-alassio.jpg
category: Sweets
cuisine: Liguria
tags:
  - egg whites
  - vegetarian
  - gluten free
yield: 12 bakies (two make a portion)
prepTime: 1h

tools:
- A vertical mixer equipped with a whisk (suggested) or an electric whisker
- A pastry bag with a star tip (~14mm size) or a small ice-cream scoop
- Baking paper
- Oven
- "[OPTIONAL] a rack for sweets"
- "[OPTIONAL] ice"
- "[OPTIONAL] food processor"

ingredients:
- 150g white sugar
- 190g of fine hazelnut flour (or peeled hazelnuts and a spice grinder)
- 20g honey
- 17g unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 or 3 egg whites (about 80g)
- 50g cream
- 75g dark chocolate

directions:
- If the hazelnut flour you have is too coarse (like a granola) you can put it in a food processor and give it a few blitzes, just be sure to not reduce it in a paste
- If you have a vertical mixer put the egg whites in and start the whisk on medium speed, we'll need very stiff peaks for this recipe
- Weigh and **mix sugar, honey, hazelnut flour and cocoa**
- "**Whisk the egg whites** if not already done"
- "**Mix** the egg whites with the rest, trying not to push out too much air"
- Pre-heat **oven at 180Â°C**
- Put the star tip in the **pastry bag**, then add the mix. You can put the bag in a tall glass to help you in this process, if you do so remember to bend the tip (facing up) so that you don't pour the mix in the glass
- Put **baking paper** on the oven tray
- Use the pastry bag to make **roughly 24 cookies**
- "**Bake for 13 minutes**, in the meantime continue with the following steps. Whenever they are ready take them out of the oven and let them cool on a rack or just on a cool tray"
- Put the **cream in a small pan** on medium heat, take it off as soon as it boils (continue with the following steps in the meantime)
- "**Cut the dark chocolate** into small bits"
- When the cream starts boiling take it off the heat, add the chocolate and mix (the **chocolate should completely melt and mix with the cream**)
- Put the mix in the fridge for 10'. You can accelerate the **cooldown** if you put the pan in a bigger pan with ice and water in it (this is what I usually do, in which case I just move to the next step, no wait).
- "**Whisk** the chocolate mix until you get a **mousse** (you'll se the mix will become lighter in color)"
- "**Composition**: take one of the cookies (they need to be cool) and add some of the mousse (a teaspoon) on the flat side, then take another and put it on top."
- Repeat previous step until you run out of cookies
- Eat the leftover mousse

They can be preserved at room temperature for roughly a week. I strongly advise against freezing.

I think they are **best after one or two days**, not immediately after made.
