  - mushrooms
yield: 1
prepTime: 20

ingredients:
- 80g rice (Carnaroli or Arborio)
- 7g butter (or margarine/olive oil if you want the ðŸŒ¿veganðŸŒ¿ variant)
- grated parmesan
- 50ml of wine (variety depends on the flavor you pick, for mushrooms we'll go with white Sauvignon or Chardonnay)
- 0.5 shallots or white onion
- vegetable stock dice (I'll upload a recipe to make them yourself) or vegetable stock
- extra-virgin olive oil
- "Flavor: see description below, for this we will go with 50g of mushrooms"

directions:
- Put on a kettle with some boiling water. If you are using stock put it in a pot to warm up instead.
- Finely **dice the onion/shallots**
- Put shallots in a pan with tall sides or a pot (I prefer to use non-stick ones).
- "**Stir-fry the onions** on medium heat with some olive oil until transparent (don't brown them)"
- Add the **rice** (no water yet) and **toast** it for a while until you hear some faint popping (~2 minutes)
- Add the **wine**, which should evaporate more or less instantly
- Wait for the wine to be evaporated/absorbed
- Add a bit of boiling water/stock, just enough to cover the rice
- Add the stock dice (if you are not using actual stock)
- Add the flavor (in this case mushrooms)
- Set a timer for 15 minutes
- Keep stirring for the entire duration (at least once every minute). Every time water is absorbed and it doesn't cover the rice anymore add some boiling water/stock.
- When the timer expires stop adding water and add the butter/margarine
- Set the hob to high heat, and stir vigorously for three more minutes
- After three minutes add the parmesan, stir and serve

Doses are per person, I suggest making it for at least two people.
