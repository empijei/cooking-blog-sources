yield: 1
prepTime: 20

ingredients:
- 80g rice Carnaroli (or Arborio if you can't find it)
- 7g butter (or margarine/olive oil if you want the ðŸŒ¿veganðŸŒ¿ variant)
- grated parmesan
- 50ml of wine (variety depends on the flavor you pick, for mushrooms we'll go with white Sauvignon or Chardonnay)
- 0.5 shallots or white onion
- vegetable stock dice (I'll upload a recipe to make them yourself) or vegetable stock
- extra-virgin olive oil
- "Flavor: see description below, for this we will go with 50g of mushrooms"

directions:
- Put on a kettle with some boiling water. If you are using stock put it in a pot to warm up instead.
- Finely **dice the onion/shallots**
- Put shallots in a pan with tall sides or a pot (I prefer to use non-stick ones).
- "**Stir-fry the onions** on medium heat with some olive oil until transparent (don't brown them)"
- Add the **rice** (no water yet) and **toast** it for a while until you hear some faint popping (~2 minutes)
- Add the **wine**, which should evaporate more or less instantly
- Wait for the wine to be evaporated/absorbed
- Add a bit of boiling water/stock, just enough to cover the rice
- Add the stock dice (if you are not using actual stock)
- Add the flavor (in this case mushrooms)
- Set a timer for 17 minutes (this depends on the rice you are using)
- Keep stirring for the entire duration (at least once every couple of minutes in a pot, once every 5 if you use a large skillet). Every time water is absorbed and it doesn't cover the rice anymore add some boiling water/stock
- A couple of minutes before the timer expires stop adding water
- When the timer expires remove from the heat and add the butter/margarine and the grated parmesan
- Stir vigorously until butter is melted and cheese is incorporated
- Cover with a lid or a towel and let rest for a minute or two before serving

Doses are per person, I suggest making it for at least two people.
